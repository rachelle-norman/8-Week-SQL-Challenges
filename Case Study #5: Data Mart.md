## Questions and Solutions

## Data Cleansing Steps

**In a single query, perform the following operations and generate a new table in the `data_mart` schema named `clean_weekly_sales`**

- **Convert the `week_date` to a `DATE` format**

- **Add a `week_number` as the second column for each `week_date` value. Ex: January 1st to January 7th would be 1, January 8th to the 14th would be 2, etc.**

- **Add a `month_number` with the calendar month for each `week_date` value as the 3rd column**

- **Add a `calendar_year` column as the 4th column containing either 2018, 2019, or 2020 values**

- **Add a new column called `age_band` after the original `segment` column using the following mapping:**
  
| segment | age_band |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Young Adults |
| 2 | Middle Aged |
| 3 | Retirees |

- **Add a new `demographic` column using the following mapping:**

| segment | demographic |
| --- | --- |
| C | Couples |
| F | Families |

- **Ensure all `null` string values are changed to an `"unknown"` string value in the original `segment` column as well as the new `age_band` and `demographic` columns.**

- **Generate a new `avg_transaction` column rounded to 2 decimal places for each record.**

## Before and After Analysis

**The `week_date` value of `2020-06-15` is the baseline week as this is when the sustainable packaging changes came into effect. All `week_date` values for `2020-06-15` mark the start of the period AFTER the change and all of the previous `week_date` values mark BEFORE the change.**

**#1: What is the total sales for the 4 weeks before and after `2020-06-15`? What is the growth or reduction rate in actual values and percentages of sales?**

**#2: What about the entire 12 weeks before and after?**

**#3: How do the sales metrics for these 2 periods before and after compare with the previous years in 2018 and 2019?**
