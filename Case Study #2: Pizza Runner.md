## Objective

Danny launched Pizza Runner, an innovative pizza delivery service inspired by 80s retro styling, aiming to combine his love for pizza with an Uber-like model, recruiting runners for deliveries and developing a mobile app but requires further assistance to clean his data and apply some basic calculations so he can better direct his runners and optimise Pizza Runner‚Äôs operations.

## üßº Data Cleaning and Transformation

## Table: customer_orders

<img src="https://github.com/rachelle-norman/8-Week-SQL-Challenges/assets/129090943/3fadfd92-772f-4b51-92d0-fa27876b3219" alt="Image" width="750">
<br> </br>

**Issues:** Null values in the `exclusions` and `extras` columns.

**Actions to Clean:**
````sql
SELECT
	*
FROM
	customer_orders;

UPDATE customer_orders
SET extras = ' '
WHERE extras IS NULL
	OR extras = 'null'
;

UPDATE customer_orders
SET exclusions = ' '
WHERE exclusions IS NULL
	OR exclusions = 'null'
;
````
- Run a `SELECT *` statement to select all columns from the tables to see the data and the data types to identify where the issues in the table lie.
- Since the data type for both the `exclusions` and `extras` tables is 'VARCHAR(4)`, update the null values to ' ' since it's also a string.
- Highlight and run the `SELECT *` statement again after running the `UPDATE` statements to ensure the data accurately reflects the changes.

Here is the updated table:

<img src="https://github.com/rachelle-norman/8-Week-SQL-Challenges/assets/129090943/072bf428-a419-4947-9744-a06b031bd0bb" img="Image" width="750">
<br> </br>

## Table: runner_orders

<img src="https://github.com/rachelle-norman/8-Week-SQL-Challenges/assets/129090943/26ace5d1-2085-4679-8862-77a660609dd5" img="Image" width="750">
<br> </br>

**Issues:** Mismatched data types, inconsistent values

**Actions to Clean:**
````sql
SELECT 
	*
FROM
	runner_orders;

UPDATE runner_orders
	SET pickup_time = NULL
	WHERE pickup_time ='null';
	
UPDATE runner_orders
	SET			
		distance = CASE
			WHEN distance LIKE '%km%' THEN TRIM('%km%' FROM distance)
			WHEN distance = 'null' THEN '0'
			ELSE distance
		END,
			
		duration = CASE
			WHEN duration LIKE '%mins' THEN TRIM('%mins' FROM duration)
			WHEN duration LIKE '%minute' THEN TRIM('%minute' FROM duration)	
			WHEN duration LIKE '%minutes' THEN TRIM('%minutes' FROM duration)
			WHEN duration LIKE 'null' THEN '0'
			ELSE duration
			END,
			
		cancellation = CASE
			WHEN cancellation IS NULL THEN ' '
			WHEN cancellation = 'null' THEN ' '
			ELSE cancellation
			END
;
````
- Set the `pickup_time` `'null'` strings to actual `NULL` values. Note: Since we're changing the data types later and blank strings cannot exist in timestamp values, it's probably best for this one to stay as a `NULL`.
- Use `CASE` functions to`TRIM` the letters out of the `distance` and `duration` columns and set the `'null'` string values to `'0'` to make it easier to `CAST` to another data type later.
- Use another `CASE` function to change `NULL` values and `'null'` strings to blank space.
<br> </br>  
````sql
CREATE TABLE runner_orders_updated AS 
	SELECT
		CAST(order_id AS bigint),
		runner_id,
		CAST(pickup_time AS timestamp),
		CAST(distance AS float),
		CAST(duration AS int),
		cancellation
	FROM
		runner_orders;

SELECT 
	*
FROM
	runner_orders_updated;

DROP TABLE runner_orders;

ALTER TABLE runner_orders_updated
RENAME TO runner_orders
;
````
- Create a new table and insert the columns from the original table, using a `CAST` function on the columns where we want to update the data type.
- `CAST` the `order_id` column as `bigint` because we might have more orders later on and might need an integer data type with more space and the `pickup_time` column as `timestamp` so we can easily make calculations with other date columns in the schema.
- `CAST` the `distance` column as a floating-point number since the original column has decimals and the `duration` column as `integer`.
- Run a `SELECT *` statement on the new table to ensure that all of the columns from the original table are in the new table as the proper data type.
- Delete the original `runner_orders` table and rename the new, correctly updated table to `runner_orders`.
- Rerun the `SELECT *` from the beginning of the query using the original `runner_orders` table name to ensure that all changes have been reflected.

Here is the updated table:

<img src="https://github.com/rachelle-norman/8-Week-SQL-Challenges/assets/129090943/3bfdbdc0-b4db-4ba4-a16c-bb545c17c784" img="Image" width="750">

## Table: pizza_names

<img src="https://github.com/rachelle-norman/8-Week-SQL-Challenges/assets/129090943/4d99a83a-eb1f-44d5-b761-72742995626b" alt="Image" width="250">
<br> </br>

**Issues:** Incorrect spacing

**Actions to Clean:**
````sql
UPDATE pizza_names
SET pizza_name = 'Meat Lovers'
WHERE pizza_name = 'Meatlovers'
````
- Run a quick `UPDATE` statement to correct formatting in the `pizza_name` column.

Here are the changes reflected:

## Questions and Solutions

## Pizza Metrics

**#1: How many pizzas were ordered?**

````sql
SELECT
	COUNT(*) AS number_of_pizzas
FROM
	customer_orders
;
````
#### Steps:
- Run a `COUNT(*)` function on the `customer_orders` table to count how many instances there are.

#### Answer:
| number_of_pizzas |
| --- |
| 14 |

There were 14 pizzas ordered total.

***

**#2: How many unique customer orders were made?**

````sql
SELECT
	COUNT(DISTINCT c.order_id) AS number_of_orders
FROM
	customer_orders c
;
````
#### Steps:
- Run a `COUNT (DISTINCT)` function on the `c.order_id` column in the `customer_orders` table to count only unique order IDs and not any duplicates.

#### Answer:

| number_of_orders |
| --- |
| 10 |

There were 10 unique customer orders made.

***

**#3: How many successful orders were delivered by each runner?**

````sql
SELECT
	r.runner_id,
	COUNT(r.order_id) AS number_of_orders
FROM
	runner_orders r
WHERE
	pickup_time IS NOT null
GROUP BY
	r.runner_id
ORDER BY
	r.runner_id
;
````
#### Steps:
- Run a `COUNT` function on the `r.order_id` column in the `runner_orders` table to count how many orders were made by the runners
- Filter the results where the `r.pickup_time` isn't `NULL` as this indicates an order cancellation.
- Group the results by the `r.runner_id` to aggregate the number of orders for each runner.
- Order the results by the `r.runner_id` for easier readability.

#### Answer:

| runner_id | number_of_orders |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | 4 |
| 2 | 3 |
| 3 | 1 |

Runner 1 delivered 4 orders.
Runner 2 delivered 3 orders.
Runner 3 delivered 1 order.

***

**#4: How many of each type of pizza was delivered?**

````sql
WITH delivered_orders AS (
		SELECT 
			r.order_id
		FROM 
			runner_orders r
		WHERE
			r.pickup_time IS NOT NULL
)

--- end of cte ---

SELECT
	p.pizza_name,
	COUNT(c.pizza_id) AS delivered_count
FROM
	pizza_names p
		JOIN customer_orders c
			ON p.pizza_id=c.pizza_id
		JOIN delivered_orders d
			ON c.order_id=d.order_id
GROUP BY
	p.pizza_name
ORDER BY
	p.pizza_name
;
````
#### Steps:
- Create a CTE that stores the order IDs of all orders that were delivered by using the `r.pickup_time` to filter out any cancelled orders.
- Run a `COUNT` function to find the number of each type of pizza that was ordered.
- Use a `JOIN` clause to combine the `pizza_names` table to the `customers` table to retrieve the pizza name for each pizza ID.
- Use a 2nd `JOIN` to further combine the tables with the CTE to only show results if the order was actually delivered.
- Group and order the results by the `p.pizza_name`.

#### Answer:

| pizza_name | delivered_count |
| --- | --- |
| Meat Lovers | 9 |
| Vegetarian | 3 |


The Meat Lovers pizza was delivered 9 times.
The Vegetarian pizza was delivered 3 times.

***

**#5: How many Vegetarian and Meat Lovers were ordered by each customer?**

````sql
SELECT
	c.customer_id,
	p.pizza_name,
	COUNT(c.pizza_id) AS order_count
FROM
	customer_orders c
		JOIN pizza_names p
			ON c.pizza_id=p.pizza_id
GROUP BY
	c.customer_id,
	p.pizza_name
ORDER BY 
	c.customer_id
;
````
#### Steps:
- Use a `COUNT` function to count the number of pizzas ordered.
- Use a `JOIN` clause on the `customer_orders` table and the `pizza_names` table to retrieve the names of the pizzas. 
- Group the results by the `c.customer_id` and `p.pizza_name` columns and order them by the `c.customer_id`.
  
#### Answer:
| customer_id | pizza_name | order_count |
| 101 | Meat Lovers | 2 |
| 101 | Vegetarian | 1 |
| 102 | Meat Lovers | 2 |
| 102 | Vegetarian | 1 |
| 103 | Meat Lovers | 3 |
| 103 | Vegetarian | 1 |
| 104 | Meat Lovers | 3 |
| 105 | Vegetarian | 1 |

Customer 101 and 102 both ordered 2 Meat Lovers and 1 Vegetarian pizza.
Customer 103 ordered 3 Meat Lovers and 1 Vegetarian pizza.
Customer 104 ordered 3 Meat Lovers pizzas.
Customer 105 ordered 1 Vegetarian pizza.

***

**#6: What was the maximum number of pizzas delivered in a single order?**

````sql
SELECT
	MAX(number_of_pizzas) AS max_number_of_pizzas
FROM (
--- subquery to find the amount of pizzas per order ---
	SELECT
		c.order_id,
		COUNT(c.pizza_id) AS number_of_pizzas
	FROM
		customer_orders c
	GROUP BY
		c.order_id
	) AS pizza_per_order
;
````
#### Steps:
- Since it's not possible to nest aggregate functions, use a `MAX` function on a `COUNT` function alias provided in a subquery used to count the number of pizzas per order.

#### Answer:
| max_number_of_pizzas |
| --- |
| 3 |

The highest number of pizzas in a single order is 3.
