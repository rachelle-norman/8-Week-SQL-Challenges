## Objective

Danny launched Pizza Runner, an innovative pizza delivery service inspired by 80s retro styling, aiming to combine his love for pizza with an Uber-like model, recruiting runners for deliveries and developing a mobile app but requires further assistance to clean his data and apply some basic calculations so he can better direct his runners and optimise Pizza Runner‚Äôs operations.

## üßº Data Cleaning & Transformation

## Table: customer_orders

<img src="https://github.com/rachelle-norman/8-Week-SQL-Challenges/assets/129090943/3fadfd92-772f-4b51-92d0-fa27876b3219" alt="Image" width="750">
<br> </br>

**Issues:** Null values in the `exclusions` and `extras` columns.

**Actions to Clean:**
````sql
SELECT
	*
FROM
	customer_orders;

UPDATE customer_orders
SET extras = ' '
WHERE extras IS NULL
	OR extras = 'null'
;

UPDATE customer_orders
SET exclusions = ' '
WHERE exclusions IS NULL
	OR exclusions = 'null'
;
````
- Run a `SELECT *` statement to select all columns from the tables to see the data and the data types to identify where the issues in the table lie.
- Since the data type for both the `exclusions` and `extras` tables is 'VARCHAR(4)`, update the null values to ' ' since it's also a string.
- Highlight and run the `SELECT *` statement again after running the `UPDATE` statements to ensure the data accurately reflects the changes.

Here is the updated table:

## Table: runner_orders

<br> </br>

**Issues:** Mismatched data types, inconsistent values

**Actions to Clean:**
````sql
SELECT 
	*
FROM
	runner_orders;

UPDATE runner_orders
	SET pickup_time = NULL
	WHERE pickup_time ='null';
	
UPDATE runner_orders
	SET			
		distance = CASE
			WHEN distance LIKE '%km%' THEN TRIM('%km%' FROM distance)
			WHEN distance = 'null' THEN '0'
			ELSE distance
		END,
			
		duration = CASE
			WHEN duration LIKE '%mins' THEN TRIM('%mins' FROM duration)
			WHEN duration LIKE '%minute' THEN TRIM('%minute' FROM duration)	
			WHEN duration LIKE '%minutes' THEN TRIM('%minutes' FROM duration)
			WHEN duration LIKE 'null' THEN '0'
			ELSE duration
			END,
			
		cancellation = CASE
			WHEN cancellation IS NULL THEN ' '
			WHEN cancellation = 'null' THEN ' '
			ELSE cancellation
			END
;
````
- Set the `pickup_time` `'null'` strings to actual `NULL` values. Note: Since we're changing the data types later and blank strings cannot exist in timestamp values, it's probably best for this one to stay as a `NULL`.
- Use `CASE` functions to`TRIM` the letters out of the `distance` and `duration` columns and set the `'null'` string values to `'0'` to make it easier to `CAST` to another data type later.
- Use another `CASE` function to change `NULL` values and `'null'` strings to blank space.
<br> </br>  
````sql
CREATE TABLE runner_orders_updated AS 
	SELECT
		CAST(order_id AS bigint),
		runner_id,
		CAST(pickup_time AS timestamp),
		CAST(distance AS float),
		CAST(duration AS int),
		cancellation
	FROM
		runner_orders;

SELECT 
	*
FROM
	runner_orders_updated;

DROP TABLE runner_orders;

ALTER TABLE runner_orders_updated
RENAME TO runner_orders
;
````
- Create a new table and insert the columns from the original table, using a `CAST` function on the columns where we want to update the data type.
- `CAST` the `order_id` column as `bigint` because we might have more orders later on and might need an integer data type with more space and the `pickup_time` column as `timestamp` so we can easily make calculations with other date columns in the schema.
- `CAST` the `distance` column as a floating-point number since the original column has decimals and the `duration` column as `integer`.
- Run a `SELECT *` statement on the new table to ensure that all of the columns from the original table are in the new table as the proper data type.
- Delete the original `runner_orders` table and rename the new, correctly updated table to `runner_orders`.
- Rerun the `SELECT *` from the beginning of the query using the original `runner_orders` table name to ensure that all changes have been reflected.

Here is the updated table:

## Table 3

<img src="https://github.com/rachelle-norman/8-Week-SQL-Challenges/assets/129090943/f8dcd5ad-4377-40fc-a07f-f52c012e5836" alt="Image" width="750">


## Questions and Solutions

**#1: What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?**

````sql
SELECT
	s.customer_id,
	SUM(m.price) AS total_spent
FROM
	sales s
		JOIN menu m
			ON s.product_id=m.product_id
GROUP BY
	s.customer_id
ORDER BY
	s.customer_id
;
````
#### Steps:
- Use the `JOIN` clause to merge the `sales` table and the `menu` table on the `product_id` columns in both tables since `s.customer_id` and `m.price` are from the two different tables.
- Use the `SUM` function on the `m.price` column to calculate the total amount spent per customer.
- Aggregate the results by the `s.customer_id` and order it by the same column for easier readability.

#### Answer:
| customer_id | total_spent |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| A | 76 |
| B | 74 |
| C | 36 |

- Customer A spent $76.
- Customer B spent $74.
- Customer C spent $36.
