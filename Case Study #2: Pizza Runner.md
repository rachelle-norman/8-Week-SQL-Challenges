## Questions and Solutions

**#1: What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?**

````sql
SELECT
	s.customer_id,
	SUM(m.price) AS total_spent
FROM
	sales s
		JOIN menu m
			ON s.product_id=m.product_id
GROUP BY
	s.customer_id
ORDER BY
	s.customer_id
;
````
#### Steps:
- Use the `JOIN` clause to merge the `sales` table and the `menu` table on the `product_id` columns in both tables since `s.customer_id` and `m.price` are from the two different tables.
- Use the `SUM` function on the `m.price` column to calculate the total amount spent per customer.
- Aggregate the results by the `s.customer_id` and order it by the same column for easier readability.

#### Answer:
| customer_id | total_spent |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| A | 76 |
| B | 74 |
| C | 36 |

- Customer A spent $76.
- Customer B spent $74.
- Customer C spent $36.
