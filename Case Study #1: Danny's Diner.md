## Questions and Solutions

**#1: What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?**

**#2: How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?**

**#3: What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer**

**#4: What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?**

**#5: Which item was the most popular for each customer?**

**#6: Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?**

**#7: Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?**

**#8: What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?**

**#9: If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?**

**#10: In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?**

## BONUS QUESTIONS

**Join All the Things**

**Recreate the table with customer_id, order_date, product_name, price, and member (Y/N).**

***

**Rank All the Things**

**Danny also requires further information about the ```ranking``` of customer products, but he purposely does not need the ranking for non-member purchases so he expects null ```ranking``` values for the records when customers are not yet part of the loyalty program.**
