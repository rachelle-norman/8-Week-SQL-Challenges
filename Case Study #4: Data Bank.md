## Data Allocation Challenge

**To test out a few hypotheses, the Data Bank team wants to run an experiment where different groups of customers would be allocated data using three different options:**

  **- Option 1: Data is allocated based off the amount of money at the end of the previous month**

  **- Option 2: Data is allocated based on the average amount of money kept in the account in the previous 30 days**

  **- Option 3: Data is updated real time**

**Generate the following to help the Data Bank team estimate how much data will need to be provisioned for each option:**

  **- Running customer balance column that includes the impact of each transaction**
  
  **- Customer balance at the end of each month**
  
  **- Minimum, average, and maximum values of the running balance for each customer**

**Using all of the data available, how much data would be required for each option on a monthly basis?**
