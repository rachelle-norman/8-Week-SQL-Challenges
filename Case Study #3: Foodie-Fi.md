## Challenge Payment Question

**#1: The Foodie-Fi team wants you to create a new `payments` table for the year 2020 that includes amounts paid by each customer in the `subscriptions` table with the following requirements:**
  **- Monthly payments always occur on the same day of the month as the original `start_date` of any monthly paid plan**
  **- Upgrades from basic to monthly or pro plans are reduced by the current paid amount in that month and start immediately**
  **- Upgrades from pro monthly to pro annual are paid at the end of the current billing period and also starts at the end of the month period**
  **- Once a customer churns, they will no longer make payments**
  **- Columns should include: `customer_id`, `plan_id`, `plan_name`, `payment_date`, `amount`, `payment_order`**
